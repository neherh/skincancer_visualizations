# Cancer Similarity with Siamese Networks in Pytorch

The goal of this project is to accurately determine between benign and malignant skin images and in turn encode the images into a distint map. 

This project uses pytorch. Any dataset can be used. Each class must be in its own folder. This is the same structure that PyTorch's own image folder dataset uses.

Inspiration was taken from the following article: https://hackernoon.com/one-shot-learning-with-siamese-networks-in-pytorch-8ddaab10340e

#### Executing scripts

$ python3 Siamese-networks-medium.py train

$ python3 Siamese-networks-medium.py test


#### Dependencies
